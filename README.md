Faking audio bounce using Navmesh

How to use:
create an empty where the origin of the audio source should be, add the code to it, give the code Player and the Audio Source Object and if you have the navmesh baked it should just work (also set the sound distance and the volume, volume is calculated based on the navmesh path distance)
